### Function Library Assignment 2
This Py file creates different functions that are used across all the following Jupyter Notebooks. The functions are:
* Read Data
This function reads and processes all the input data.
* Mapping Dictionaries
This function maps the node location of each generator and wind farm in the power system.

---------------------------------------------
### Task 0, Wind data processing
This Jupyter Notebook processes the data from the wind farms.
* First it plots all the scenarios for the 6 different windfarms together with the average of each scenario across the available 37 hours
* It then saves and plots the average values from hour 13 to 37 which will be used for the optimization tasks
